# Kharon is a small Greasemonkey/HTML5 script that rewrite some darknet links to a proxyfied version.

This action is performed to permit access to the darknet also in situations where the direct connection it's not available.

# Kharons's actually offered doorways

Actually Kharon offers a doorway to the following darknets:

 - Tor, throught tor2web.org;
 - I2P, throught i2p.to.

# How it works

Kharon periodically checks the access to the darknets and performs the following actions:

  - the darknet it's available?
      => it assures that no proxified link versions are used performing a rewrite to direct links.

  - the darknet it's not available?
      => it replaces direct links to the darknet with a proxified version.

# How checks are implemented ?

Due the the "same origin policy" a real realiable check can't be fulfilled.
Actually we are testing the same hack used in javascript portscanning technique (SPI Dynamics / gnucityzen).
